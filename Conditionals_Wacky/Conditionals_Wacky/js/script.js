//The following code will be calculating how many slices of pizza each person at a dinner party can have based on ordering 8

//var numberOfAttendees = prompt("How many people are coming to the pizza party?"); //The user will input how many people are coming to the party
//var numberOfPizzasBeingOrdered = prompt("How many pizzas are you ordering?");
//var numberOfSlicesInOnePie = prompt("How many slices come in a whole pizza");//The user will input how many slices are in one whole pizza
//var howMuchEachPersonCanHave = numberOfAttendees * numberOfSlicesInOnePie /5; //calculates how many slices each person at the party can have


//console.log(howMuchEachPersonCanHave); //Prints to the console how many slices each person can have

//alert("Each person can have this many slices: " +  howMuchEachPersonCanHave); //This will calculate how many slices each person at the pizza party can have

//var howMuchEachPersonCanHave = 8; //After taking the users input we found that each person at the pizza party can have 8 slices of pizza

//The following is a ternary example of the scenario including a relational operator

//(howMuchEachPersonCanHave > 5) ? console.log("This will be enough to fill each person up") : console.log("You may need to order some more pizzas")

//The following is an example of if and else also including a relational operator

var numberOfSlicesInONePie = 8; //These number are representing dollars per hour
var howMuchEachPersonCanHave = 6; //These numbers are representing dollars per hour


if(howMuchEachPersonCanHave < numberOfSlicesInONePie){//code performed if condition is true
console.log("You will have enough to feed everyone"); //this will print to the console if the person will be getting what they want to get an hour
}else{console.log("You may need to order more pizza")}//condition performed if the desired hourly increase is less than what the person wants
