//The following code will be calculating how much more an hour a person will make if they get a raise every three months for two years.

var raiseAmount = prompt("How much are your raises?"); //The user will input how much of a raise they will get
var numberOfRaises = prompt("How many raises will you get in two years");//The user will input how many raises they will get over two years
var hourlyIncrease = raiseAmount * numberOfRaises; //calculates how much more an hour the person will make after two years of raises every three months

console.log(hourlyIncrease); //Prints to the console how much more an hour they will be making

alert("You will make this much more an hour if you get a raise every three months for two years: " +  hourlyIncrease); //This will calculate how much more the person will be making an hour based on the number of raises they get
