//The following code will be calculating how much more an hour a person will make if they get a raise every three months for two years.

//var raiseAmount = prompt("How much are your raises?"); //The user will input how much of a raise they will get
//var numberOfRaises = prompt("How many raises will you get in two years");//The user will input how many raises they will get over two years
//var hourlyIncrease = raiseAmount * numberOfRaises; //calculates how much more an hour the person will make after two years of raises every three months

//console.log(hourlyIncrease); //Prints to the console how much more an hour they will be making

//alert("You will make this much more an hour if you get a raise every three months for two years: " +  hourlyIncrease); //This will calculate how much more the person will be making an hour based on the number of raises they get

//var hourlyIncrease = 4; //After taking the users input we found that they will make an extra four dollars an hour if their raises are 50 cent


//The following is a ternary example of the scenario including a relational operator

//(hourlyIncrease >= 4) ? console.log("You are considered pay grade four") : console.log("You are still pay grade three")

//The following is an example of if and else also including a relational operator

var hourlyIncrease = 4; //These number are representing dollars per hour
var desiredIncrease = 6; //These numbers are representing dollars per hour


if(hourlyIncrease > desiredIncrease){//code performed if condition is true
console.log("You have received your desired hourly pay"); //this will print to the console if the person will be getting what they want to get an hour
}else{console.log("You have to get a few more raises before you will have the desired hourly pay")}//condition performed if the desired hourly increase is less than what the person wants
