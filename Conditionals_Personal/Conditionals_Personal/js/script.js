//var weeklySavings = prompt("How much money do you save a week?"); //The user will input how much they save a week
//var numberOfWeeksInMonth = prompt("How many weeks are in this month?");//The user will input how many weeks are in the current month
//var monthlySavings = weeklySavings * numberOfWeeksInMonth; //calculates how much I will save depending on how many weeks are in the month.
//console.log(monthlySavings); //Prints to the console

//alert("You will save " + monthlySavings); //This will calculate and tell me how much I will save for the month.

var monthlySavings = 250; //After taking the users input we found that they will save 250 for the month.

(monthlySavings > 200) ? console.log("You can take a trip") : console.log("You have to stay in town") //This is a ternary example of the scenario
